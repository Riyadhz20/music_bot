Since a lot of discord music bots are being blocked by youtube nowadays I've decided to write up a quick project that will allow anyone to host their own discord bot. This bot includes the following commands:

* `/help` - displays all the available commands
* `/p "keywords"` - finds the song on youtube and plays it in your current channel. Will resume playing the current song if it was paused
* `/q` - displays the current music queue
* `/skip` - skips the current song being played
* `/clear` - Stops the music and clears the queue
* `/leave` - Disconnected the bot from the voice channel
* `/pause` - pauses the current song being played or resumes if already paused
* `/resume` - resumes playing the current song


# Installation
To run the discord bot all you need is `python 3.4` or above.\
install dependencies of the python that are needed for the bot.\

>Please note that you will need to have [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) installed and make sure that the path to the bin folder is in your environment variables.
